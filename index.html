        <h3>Why am I taking this class?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              I am taking this course because I want to broaden my web
              development <br />
              skills. I have heard that this course is extremely important
              because it <br />
              teaches the fundamentals of web development which can be built
              upon later. <br />
              I want to be a software developer, and having the front end part
              of <br />
              development will be useful.

          What experience do you have creating content for the web or
          programming?

            <p>
              I am a computer science major so I have taken many coding classes
              <br />
              and theory at this point because I only have a few classes left of
              <br />
              the major -- whoop whoop :). I worked for a company over the
              <br />
              summer as their web developer, but I had no knowledge of web
              <br />
              development beforehand. It was an interesting experience because I
              <br />
              had to learn as I went, so I am excited to have formal <br />
              instruction.

          <li>
            Become a better web developer, practice coding, and broaden my
            skills.

          I did the command line and the Git learn-computring activity. The
          <br />
          command line learning activiy opened my eyes to new commands. <br />
          I knew some basics beforehand, but it is useful to go over them again.
          Especially

        <p>
          Git is a powerful tool in version control. It helps keep track of
          <br />
          changes, and is very useful for collobrative projects. <br />
          I have used GitHub before, but (again) had no formal teaching of it
          <br />
          You can push, pull from repositories. Additionally, one can branch and
          fork <br />
          of the main branch to have multiple versions and collabrations. <br />

        <p>
          <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-air/">Apple</a> — Everyone knows
          Apple for making clean products. <br />
          Their websites are no different. Scrolling through the iPad Air page
          <br />
          that is linked, is a graphical experience like no other. Apple does a
          <br />
          remarkable job at incorporating motion into their pages.

        <p>
          <a href="https://activetheory.net/home"> Active Theory</a> — I
          stumbled upon this website when I was looking up cool <br />
          graphical websites. This site incorporates many graphical surprises.
          Every page <br />
          has an unique element, and is worth exploring deeply
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://locomotive.ca/en">Locomotive</a> — I found this website
        when looking for other cool websites. <br />
        It is not the most neat, but the <br />
        elements of the page are interactive and fun. My computer cannot handle
        <br />
        it that well because of the intense motion they created. <br />

      If you set a goal for yourself and are able to achieve it, you have won
      your race. Your goal can be to come in first, to improve your performance,
      or just finish the race; its up to you
